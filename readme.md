# Line Drawer
## Info
This is a simple program to print some lines into the screen using the random library from c and SDL. I leave nothing but the c source code cause I don't know shit about cmake.

## Keyboard
"Space" to generate lines, "r" to clear canvas, "j" to do both.

## Roawr
ROOOOAAWWWRR!!!
